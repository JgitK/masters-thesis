### Welcome to my Master's Thesis!

In this analysis, I investigate "over-reporting intentions" among eligible  US Presidential Election voters, a phenomenon in which individuals report their positive intention to turnout at the polls, but never follow through in doing so. Leveraging the Cooperative Election Study (CES) survey data along with validated voter information, regression techniques are deployed to scrutinize how varying levels of online political activity impact the likelihood of overstating one's voting intentions. Preliminary results suggest that individuals active in political discourse on social media platforms exhibit a reduced tendency to over-report compared to those not active online. Moreover, a distinctive pattern emerges with conservatives appearing more prone to over-report than their liberal counterparts. This R markdown is geared towards a data-driven exploration, aiming to guide policy makers and digital campaign strategists in understanding voter behavior on online platforms. It's a stepping stone towards deeper insights into the nuances of online political engagement and its implications on reported voting intentions.
